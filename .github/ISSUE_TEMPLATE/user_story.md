Please provide an approximate dollar impact. The business impact may be any of the following:

**Acceptance criteria**

Please provide acceptance criteria based on any of the following:

NOTE:

1. Acceptance criteria should be measurable and should be based on maximum possible limit.
1. Example: If the acceptance criteria for an application is based on response time, specify the response time such that post which the application will not be adopted/used at all i.e. a deal breaker. Meaning if the acceptance criteria for response time is 1 minute, the end user will NOT use the application at all if the response time is more than 1 minute.
